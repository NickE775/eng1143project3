    <h2>Introduction: The Travel Guide</h2>
    <p>
      This portfolio represents my journey through the ENGL 1143 semester.
      Think of this course as a trip, with each assignment serving as a stop
      along the way. As your guide, I will explain where I started, the
      challenges I faced, and how each project helped me grow as a writer and
      thinker.

  <section id="journey">
    <h2>The Semester Journey</h2>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the semester, my understanding of writing was mostly
      focused on structure and correctness. As the course progressed, I learned
      to think more deeply about audience, purpose, revision, and reflection.
      Each project pushed me to refine my ideas and connect my work to the
      Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) outlined in the ENGL 1143 course
      description.

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      By the end of the semester, I have gained a stronger understanding of
      writing as a process rather than a single product. This portfolio
      demonstrates both my struggles and successes, showing how each step of
      the journey contributed to my overall growth.
